🌟 Hi! I’m Nicole, and I'm a third year CS student at SFU.

🌱 I'm currently building on my UI design knowledge, using Figma and Balsamiq. I'm also learning more about Multimedia design in programming.

📚 Next thing I'd love to learn would definitely be mobile app development. Whether that be Android or IOS, I think I'd enjoy it regardless.

🖍️ My main languages include C, Java, Python, C++, and Haskell.
