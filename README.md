🌟 Hi! I’m Nicole, and I'm a third year CS student! 🌟 

🌱 I’m currently learning game development in Java! It's my first time using Java, and I'm finding it really fun.

📚 Next thing I'd love to learn would definitely be mobile app development. Whether that be Android or IOS, I think I'd enjoy it regardless.

🖍️ My languages include C, Java, C++, and Python
